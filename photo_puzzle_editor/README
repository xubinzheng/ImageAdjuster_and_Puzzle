ImageAdjuster and Puzzle

There are three tools.
Run PixelInspector.java : type your link in readFromURL, there already
one there for testing. Click anywhere, then print out the RGB of that
pixel

Run ImageAdjuster.java : same as inspector, tap your link, then you can
make chose of what to change on image, including blur, saturation and
brightness change. But itâ€™s a little bit slow or sometime need like 10s
to finish

The most interesting part, Run FramePuzzle : type your link, the photo
in there are my CS pro kmp(really good man), then click a block which
is next to empty block or the block on the same line of the empty block



----->there are some problems. 
first the frozen of imageAdjuster
second can't change the image in puzzle and the random the small block
